The #1 technical dashboard for WordPress professionals. Display PHP, MySQL, WP & server versions anywhere in admin. Monitor CPU, RAM, DB size & environment type.

== Description ==

= 🛡️ THE ESSENTIAL TECHNICAL HUD FOR EVERY WORDPRESS PROFESSIONAL =

Stop digging through hidden menus or leaving insecure `phpinfo()` files on your server. **[Version Info](https://versioninfoplugin.com "Visit the Version Info website")** is the essential technical dashboard that brings your site's most vital environment data directly into your daily workflow — the admin footer, the admin bar, or a dedicated dashboard widget.

Whether you're a freelancer managing dozens of client sites, a developer debugging a complex plugin conflict, or an agency maintaining a portfolio of high-value properties, having instant access to your **PHP version**, **MySQL version**, **WordPress version**, and **web server type** is a mission-critical utility.

**Version Info** has been trusted by WordPress professionals since 2015 and is now supercharged with a complete PRO + Agency suite for serious site monitoring. Learn more at **[versioninfoplugin.com](https://versioninfoplugin.com "Version Info official website")**.

= ✨ What Makes Version Info Different? =

Most server info plugins show you a wall of data you don't need. Version Info is designed around **the data you actually use every day**, placed exactly where you need it — no extra pages, no bloat, no performance impact.

* **Zero Configuration** — Install, activate, done. Versions appear in your footer immediately.
* **Surgical Precision** — Only shows WP, PHP, MySQL, and Server versions. No fluff.
* **Performance First** — Uses native WordPress APIs. Literally zero impact on page load.
* **Developer Hooks** — Every data point is filterable for custom integrations. See the [developer docs](https://docs.versioninfoplugin.com/developer-hooks/ "Version Info developer documentation").

= 🚀 Core Features (100% Free, Forever) =

These features will always be free. No bait-and-switch.

* 🛠️ **Admin Footer Display** — See WordPress, PHP, MySQL, and Web Server versions at the bottom of every admin page. Includes a one-click update link when a new WP version is available.
* 🚦 **WP-Admin Bar Nodes** — Pin your version stack to the admin bar for instant visibility while navigating between pages, posts, and settings.
* 📊 **Dashboard Widget** — A dedicated "At a Glance" style widget showing your complete technical stack. Enable it via Screen Options.
* 🔄 **Core Update Alerts** — Automatically compares your WP version with the latest available and shows an update link right in the footer.
* 💻 **Server Detection** — Instantly identify Apache, Nginx, LiteSpeed, or any other server software without leaving WordPress.
* 🌐 **Translation Ready** — Fully localized with translations in 13+ languages including Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Chinese, and more. [Help translate](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/version-info/ "Translate Version Info on WordPress.org").

= 🔥 PRO Plan — Advanced Site Intelligence =

Unlock real-time performance monitoring, environment safety, and proactive health checks. Built for developers who take their stack seriously.

**[Upgrade to PRO →](https://versioninfoplugin.com/pricing/ "Version Info PRO pricing")** Starting at $19/year.

* 📈 **Real-Time CPU & RAM Monitoring** — See your server's pulse, live. Visual percentage bars that auto-refresh every 60 seconds via the WordPress Heartbeat API. Cross-platform: uses `sys_getloadavg()` on Linux, COM objects on Windows, and `/proc/meminfo` for system memory. Fully cached with Transients to prevent server strain.

* 💾 **Database Size Tracking** — Know exactly how bloated your database is before it becomes a problem. Breaks down `data_length` vs. `index_length` for all tables matching your `$wpdb->prefix`. Results cached for 12 hours with a **"Scan Now" AJAX button** for on-demand fresh data. Perfect for monitoring WooCommerce database growth during peak sales.

* 🚨 **Smart Environment Indicators** — Never accidentally run a destructive query on production again. High-visibility color-coded badges in the admin bar: **Red** for Production, **Orange** for Staging, **Green** for Development/Local. Auto-detects `WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE`, Bedrock (`WP_ENV`), Kinsta, WP Engine, Pantheon, Flywheel, and more. Optional: highlight the entire admin bar border to match the environment color.

* 📜 **Audit Log of Version History** — A persistent timeline tracking every shift in your WordPress core, PHP, MySQL, plugin, and theme versions. Hooks into `upgrader_process_complete` for real-time logging of WordPress updates. Know exactly *when* and *what* changed for historical troubleshooting. Limited to the last 50 entries to prevent bloat.

* 🛡️ **Health Advisor Notifications** — Proactive alerts that predict problems before they happen. Checks your PHP and MySQL versions against known **End-of-Life (EOL) dates** and flags critical security risks. Integrates directly with the native **WordPress Site Health** screen via `site_status_tests`. Flags PHP < 8.1 as a critical security risk.

* 📤 **JSON System Info Export** — One-click download of your entire technical stack as a structured JSON file. Includes WordPress config, PHP version + all extensions, database details, active theme, all active plugins with versions, server info, and more. Ideal for attaching to support tickets, sharing with hosting providers, or archiving before migrations.

= 🏛️ Agency Plan — The Command Center for Client Portfolios =

Everything in PRO, plus enterprise-grade tools for agencies, freelancers, and hosting companies managing multiple sites.

**[Upgrade to Agency →](https://versioninfoplugin.com/pricing/ "Version Info Agency pricing")** Starting at $49/year.

* 🏷️ **Full Agency White-Labeling** — Make it *your* plugin. Replace "Version Info" and "Gaucho Plugins" with your agency's name everywhere: the plugin list, dashboard widgets, admin bar, footer, and settings page. Hide Freemius-generated Account, Contact, and Support submenus. Uses the `all_plugins` filter for seamless Plugins list rebranding.

* 👥 **Role-Based Admin Visibility** — Keep it simple for clients. A checkbox matrix lets you control exactly which WordPress user roles can see version information in the admin bar, footer, and dashboard widget. Show everything to administrators, hide everything from editors and shop managers. Default: administrator only.

* 🌐 **Multi-Site Network Dashboard** — A centralized command center for WordPress Multisite. A dedicated page under **Network Admin > Settings** shows a table of every site on the network with columns for site name, URL, WP version, PHP version, MySQL version, and database size. Uses `switch_to_blog()` safely with network transient caching. Capped at 100 sites for performance.

* 📧 **System Change Email Alerts** — Get notified the *instant* something changes. Proactive `wp_mail()` notifications the moment a hosting provider changes a PHP version, a WordPress core update completes, or any plugin/theme version shifts. Configurable recipient list (comma-separated), per-component toggles, and defaults to the site admin email.

* 🔍 **PHP Error Log Dashboard** — Debug without FTP or SSH. View the last 100 lines of your `debug.log` (or custom `error_log` path) directly inside WordPress. Uses efficient `fseek()` tail reading — never loads the full log into memory. Sensitive file paths are automatically masked with `[ABSPATH]`. Download the full log as a ZIP file for offline analysis.

= 🎯 Real-World Use Cases =

**"The Support Hero"**
A client reports a bug. Instead of asking for their login credentials, you ask them to screenshot their admin footer. You instantly know their PHP version, MySQL version, WordPress version, and web server — without ever logging into their site.

**"The WooCommerce Specialist"**
Black Friday is coming. You use **Database Tracking** to monitor table size growth during the high-traffic event. When `wp_options` grows 300% overnight, you catch the autoloaded transient bloat before it takes down the store.

**"The Agency Owner"**
You hand over a beautifully built site to a high-ticket client. With **White-Labeling**, the client never sees "Gaucho Plugins" — they see *your* agency name everywhere. With **Role-Based Visibility**, the client's editors see a clean dashboard without confusing server information.

**"The Safety-First Developer"**
You manage staging and production environments for the same client. The bright **red "Production" badge** in your admin bar prevents you from ever accidentally running a migration script on the live site. The **admin bar highlight** makes the environment unmistakable.

**"The Managed Hosting Reseller"**
You run 40 sites on a Multisite installation. The **Network Dashboard** gives you a single page showing WP, PHP, and MySQL versions across every site — perfect for planning bulk upgrades. When a host updates PHP overnight, the **Email Alert** hits your inbox before the first support ticket arrives.

**"The Remote Debugger"**
A client's site throws a white screen. You open the **Error Log Dashboard** directly in wp-admin — no FTP client, no SSH terminal. The last 100 lines show a fatal error from a plugin update. The **Version History** tab confirms the plugin updated 10 minutes ago. Root cause found in under 60 seconds.

= ⚡ Performance & Architecture =

Version Info is built with performance as the #1 priority:

* **Transients API** — All resource-heavy metrics (CPU, RAM, DB size) are cached. CPU/RAM uses 60-second TTL; database size uses 12-hour TTL.
* **Heartbeat API** — Live resource updates use the native WordPress Heartbeat, ensuring data refreshes only when the admin page is active.
* **Provider Pattern** — A `ProviderInterface` abstracts all detection logic, making it trivial to add custom providers for AWS, Kinsta, or any host-specific API.
* **Hook-First Architecture** — Every data point fires a WordPress filter (`version_info_wp_version`, `version_info_php_version`, etc.) and every render point fires an action. Extend anything without editing core files. See the [hooks reference](https://docs.versioninfoplugin.com/hooks-reference/ "Version Info hooks reference").
* **Strict Typing** — Every file uses `declare(strict_types=1)` and PHP 8.1+ typed properties for maximum reliability.
* **WordPress Coding Standards** — Follows WPCS, uses proper escaping, nonce verification, capability checks, and prepared SQL queries throughout.

= 🌍 Works With Your Stack =

Version Info auto-detects and works seamlessly with:

* **Hosts:** Kinsta, WP Engine, Pantheon, Flywheel, Cloudways, SiteGround, and any standard LAMP/LEMP host
* **Environments:** Bedrock, Trellis, Local by Flywheel, MAMP, WAMP, Docker, DevKinsta
* **Servers:** Apache, Nginx, LiteSpeed, OpenLiteSpeed, IIS
* **Multisite:** Full network-level support with dedicated Network Admin page (Agency)
* **Translations:** 13+ languages with full RTL support

= 📣 What WordPress Professionals Are Saying =

> "I install this on every client site. It saves me at least 5 minutes per support ticket." — ★★★★★

> "The environment badges alone are worth the upgrade. I'll never accidentally nuke production again." — ★★★★★

> "Finally, a server info plugin that isn't bloated with stuff I don't need." — ★★★★★

= Upgrading to 2.0 =

Version 2.0 is a major architecture upgrade. The minimum PHP requirement has been raised to **8.1**. Please verify your server meets this requirement before updating. Always backup your site before major updates. See the [upgrade guide](https://docs.versioninfoplugin.com/upgrading-to-2-0/ "Version Info 2.0 upgrade guide") for details.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin lightweight? Will it slow down my site? =

Absolutely not. The free version uses only native WordPress functions (`get_bloginfo()`, `phpversion()`, `$wpdb->get_var()`) and has near-zero performance impact. The PRO version uses the WordPress Transients API and Heartbeat API to ensure monitoring never blocks page loads or strains your server. Read more about the [performance architecture](https://docs.versioninfoplugin.com/performance/ "Version Info performance documentation").

= Does it work on WordPress Multisite? =

Yes! The free version works on a per-site basis. The Agency plan adds a dedicated **Network Admin > Settings > Version Info** page that shows WP, PHP, MySQL versions, and database sizes for every site on the network in a single table.

= Which hosting environments can the Environment Indicator detect? =

It auto-detects: `WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` (WordPress 5.5+ core), `WP_ENV` (Bedrock/Trellis), `KINSTA_ENV_TYPE`, `WPE_ENVIRONMENT` and `IS_WPE_SNAPSHOT` (WP Engine), `PANTHEON_ENVIRONMENT`, `FLYWHEEL_CONFIG_DIR`, and falls back to "Production" for unrecognized hosts. See the [full compatibility list](https://docs.versioninfoplugin.com/environment-detection/ "Version Info environment detection documentation").

= Can I use this to debug PHP errors remotely? =

Yes! The Agency plan includes a **PHP Error Log Dashboard** that reads your `debug.log` file directly inside WordPress — no FTP or SSH access needed. It shows the last 100 lines efficiently and lets you download the full log as a ZIP.

= Is the PRO version compatible with WordPress.org guidelines? =

Yes. The free version hosted on WordPress.org contains zero premium code. All PRO/Agency features are delivered via the Freemius SDK update mechanism and are clearly separated using the `@fs_premium_only` deployment directive.

= How does the Health Advisor work? =

It integrates with the native **WordPress Site Health** screen by hooking into the `site_status_tests` filter. It checks your current PHP and MySQL versions against known End-of-Life (EOL) dates and flags them as Critical (past EOL), Warning (within 6 months), or Good (actively supported).

= Can my clients see the version information? =

By default, only administrators can see version data. With the Agency plan, you get a **Role-Based Visibility** matrix that lets you choose exactly which roles (Editor, Author, Shop Manager, etc.) can see version info. You can also completely white-label the plugin so clients never know it exists.

= How do email alerts work? =

The Agency plan monitors for version changes on every `admin_init` and via `upgrader_process_complete`. When a change is detected (e.g., PHP 8.1 → 8.2, or a plugin update), it sends a plain-text email to your configured recipients listing what changed, the old version, the new version, and the timestamp.

= Is this plugin developer-friendly? =

Extremely. Every data point fires a WordPress filter (e.g., `version_info_wp_version`, `version_info_mysql_version`). Every render point fires an action. The architecture uses a `ProviderInterface` so you can register custom data providers. All files use `declare(strict_types=1)` and PHP 8.1+ typed properties. See the [developer documentation](https://docs.versioninfoplugin.com/developer-hooks/ "Version Info developer docs") for the complete hooks reference and provider API.

= Where can I find documentation? =

Complete documentation, setup guides, and developer references are available at **[docs.versioninfoplugin.com](https://docs.versioninfoplugin.com "Version Info documentation")**.

= Where can I get support? =

Free users can use the [WordPress.org support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/version-info/ "Version Info support forum"). PRO and Agency customers receive [priority support](https://versioninfoplugin.com/support/ "Version Info priority support").
